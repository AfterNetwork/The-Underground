# Underground: Remastered Release

The crystal core in the dimension has exploded, leaving the entire Underground complex destroyed. In the aftermath of this incident, the facility slowly started restoring itself anomalously, making a new site that after discovered, was designated an offical site by the 2 corporate entities who controlled the previous site. This site however, was very different. Who knows what you can discover in this new site? Let's see!

## Main Changes
- The entire facility is rebuilt from scratch, however some areas may be blocked because they are still in active developement and unfinished!
  - Current areas inaccessible: Surface, Site 2, Site 3, Scientific Offices
  - Rooms are much more detailed and meshes are being used in more proper places.
  - The map is restructured and areas are now different.
- Some NPCs will have dialouge thruought the facility, just so you don't feel lonely.
